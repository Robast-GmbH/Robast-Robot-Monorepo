# For Ubuntu 20.04 users, thereâ€™s a known issue with OpenVDB and its binaries as of July 2020 with libjmalloc.
# If you see an error such as Could not load library LoadLibrary error:
# /usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2: cannot allocate memory in static TLS block,
# it can be resolved with export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libjemalloc.so.2 until new binaries are released of OpenVDB.
