Overview for the included libraries and the corresponding license:
| Library | Licence | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bounce2 | MIT | Debouncing library for Arduino | 
| MCP_CAN | GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 | Arduino Library for the ESP32 CAN Bus | 
| NeoPixelBus | GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0 | A library to control one wire protocol RGB and RGBW leds like APA106, SK6812, WS2811, WS2812 and WS2813 that are commonly refered to as NeoPixels and two wire protocol RGB like Lpd8806, APA102 and SK9822 commonly refered to as DotStars. Supports most Arduino platforms. | 
| FastLED | MIT | This is a library for easily & efficiently controlling a wide variety of LED chipsets, like the ones sold by adafruit (Neopixel, DotStar, LPD8806), Sparkfun (WS2801), and aliexpress. In addition to writing to the leds, this library also includes a number of functions for high-performing 8bit math for manipulating your RGB values, as well as low level classes for abstracting out access to pins and SPI hardware, while still keeping things as fast as possible. Tested with Arduino up to 1.6.5 from arduino.cc. |
